# Changelog

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v1.1.3

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue (#14) where types for `mongodb-stitch-browser-sdk` were missing causing builds with TSC to fail.

## v1.1.2

### Improved API Documentation

In this release, we've added generated API docs to the NPM package bundle in the `docs` folder. We've also corrected some minor typos and omissions in the README.

### Bug Fixes

- We fixed a minor bug in the `maxAgeData` prop where it would ignore when the prop was set to `0`. This resulted in cached data still being served to the client.

## v1.1.1

### Improved Rollup documentation

We've now added an example `rollup.config.js` to the package README to help Rollup users get started with the SDK.

## v1.1.0

### Chart Caching Support

In the latest Charts cloud release, weâ€™ve given developers more control over the caching and refresh behaviour, which can improve performance and user experience. The new `maxDataAge` option allows you to specify when data should be retrieved from the cache or re-queried from the database. This can also be combined with the `autoRefresh` option to ensure charts are always kept current.

Note: as part of this change, we have deprecated the `refreshInterval` property, as the same functionality is accessible through the new `autoRefresh` and `maxDataAge` properties.

### Minor fixes

- Moved `ts-node` to a dev-dependency

## v1.0.0

### Highlights

- ðŸŽ‰ First release of the Charts Embedding SDK
- ðŸ›  Dynamically set the current theme, refresh interval, and filter
- ðŸ”’ Support for embedding authentication providers (Custom / Realm / Google)

### ðŸŽ‰ First release of the Charts Embedding SDK

We're excited to show you the first v1.0.0 release of the embedding SDK. For comprehensive documentation and guides, head on over to https://github.com/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk, or https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/master/embedding-charts-sdk/.

### ðŸ›  Embedding SDK Comamnds

The SDK unlocks interactivity in your charts that simply wasn't possible with IFrame embedding.

- You can now dynamically toggle between dark mode using `setTheme`
- Adjust how frequently your chart refreshes using `setRefreshInterval`
- Control what data is shown in your chart using `setFilter`

### ðŸ”’ Support for Embedding Authentication Providers

You can now control who can view your embedded charts by enabling authenticated embedding. With this setting enabled, you will need to pass in a function to `getUserToken` that returns a JWT with claims
representing the user attempting to view the Chart. For more information, check out our authenticated embedding example here: https://github.com/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/authenticated-custom-jwt
